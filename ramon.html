                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ramon.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Autonomous University of Yucatán, Master's degree in
                    Science with a specialization in Computer and Industrial Mathematics, and Doctorate in Science with
                    a focus on Computer Science from the Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT). I have experience
                    in teaching courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Additionally, I have worked in the
                    industry as a data scientist, undertaking various projects mostly related to data analysis and
                    modeling from diverse sources to generate specialized algorithms for problem-solving. Consequently,
                    owing to my scientific academic background and industry experience, I have been able to work and
                    collaborate with multidisciplinary groups and research, particularly in the health sector alongside
                    medical professionals, nutritionists, marine biologists, neurobiologists, and genomics experts.
                    Since 2019, I have been a Researcher for Mexico (CONACyT), and I am currently assigned to
                    CIMAT-Mérida Unit conducting research in computer vision and data science applied to national
                    issues. I am a member of the National System of Researchers, Level 1.</p>
